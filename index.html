<h1>Welcome!</h1>

<p>This site exists to help teach you the basics of programming. There are different interactive lessons to work through
at your own pace, as well as a playground area where you can experiment with whatever code you come up with right from
your browser. All the basic learning experiences are meant to happen right in your web browser without the need to
download anything. So, you can begin, stop, and then resume from anywhere you have a web browser.</p>
